Airbnb Clone Backend Blueprint


##  Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

##  Project Goals
- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

##  Technology Stack
- **Django**: High-level Python web framework for backend development.
- **Django REST Framework**: Used to build RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: Flexible query language for API interaction.
- **Celery**: Handles asynchronous tasks like notifications.
- **Redis**: For caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:**  
  Builds the parts of the app that work behind the scenes (like the engine of a car).

- **Database Administrator:**  
  Takes care of where all the app’s data is stored and keeps it organized.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Makes sure the app can be tested and updated automatically (like a robot helper).

- **Security Specialist:**  
  Protects the app and its data from bad guys.

- **Project Manager:**  
  Helps everyone work together and finishes tasks on time.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A powerful Python web framework used to build the backend APIs for the project.
- **MySQL:** A relational database system used to store all the data securely.
- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
- **Docker:** A tool to create lightweight containers for running the application in any environment.
- **GitHub Actions:** A platform to automate testing and deployment with CI/CD pipelines.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for securely handling user authentication.

## Database Design

### Key Entities and Important Fields:

- **Users**  
  Fields: id, username, email, password, role

- **Properties**  
  Fields: id, owner_id (User), title, description, location, price

- **Bookings**  
  Fields: id, property_id, user_id, start_date, end_date, status

- **Reviews**  
  Fields: id, booking_id, rating, comment, created_at

- **Payments**  
  Fields: id, booking_id, amount, payment_method, payment_status

### Relationships:

- A **User** can own multiple **Properties**.  
- A **Booking** belongs to one **Property** and one **User**.  
- A **Review** is linked to a **Booking**.  
- A **Payment** is associated with a **Booking**.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management:**  
  Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. It ensures secure access and personalized experiences.

- **Property Management:**  
  Enables users to create, update, and delete property listings. This feature allows property owners to showcase their spaces to potential guests.

- **Booking System:**  
  Lets users search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates. It manages booking status and availability to avoid conflicts.

- **Reviews and Ratings:**  
  Provides a way for guests to leave feedback after their stay. This helps maintain quality and trust within the platform.

- **Payment Processing:**  
  Handles secure payment transactions for bookings. It ensures that financial data is protected and payments are accurately recorded.

## API Security

- **Authentication:**  
  We will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to verify the identity of users before they can access protected resources. This ensures only legitimate users can use the APIs.

- **Authorization:**  
  Role-based access control will restrict users from performing actions they are not allowed to do (e.g., only property owners can edit their listings).

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  To prevent abuse and protect the API from too many requests, rate limiting will be implemented, which limits the number of requests a user or client can make in a certain time frame.

- **Data Encryption:**  
  Sensitive information like passwords and payment details will be encrypted both during transmission (using HTTPS) and when stored to protect user privacy.

Security is crucial to protect users’ personal data, prevent unauthorized access, and secure financial transactions, building trust in the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying the application. This ensures that new code changes are automatically tested and released quickly and reliably, reducing errors and speeding up development.

For this project, tools like **GitHub Actions** will be used to create automated workflows, and **Docker** will help package the application so it runs consistently across different environments.
